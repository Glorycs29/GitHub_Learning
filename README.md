## How to add colour to the text in GitHub:
### Colored text #1

You can use the diff language tag to generate some colored text:

```diff
- text in red
+ text in green
! text in orange
# text in gray
@@ text in purple (and bold)@@
```
However, it adds it as a new line starting with either - + ! # or starts and ends with @@

# Placeholders

It's worth mentioning that you can add some colour in a README using a placeholder image service. For example if you wanted to provide a list of colours for reference:

- ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `#f03c15`
- ![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) `#c5f015`
- ![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `#1589F0`
Produces:

#f03c15 #f03c15
#c5f015 #c5f015
#1589F0 #1589F0
